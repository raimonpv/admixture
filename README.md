# Admixture

`Admixture` is a Python-based command-line interface designed to compute genetic admixture from SNP data. This tool simplifies the process of determining the proportionate ancestry in individuals from multiple source populations using genotype data from one of several consumer genotyping companies. Additionally, the software provides a detailed visualization functionality of ancestry breakdown. Several models are supported, and guidance is provided for users to define their own models.

This is companion code to the final project for CSE 284 (WI24) authored by **Raimon Padr√≥s I Valls** (A59025488) and **Lucas Patel** (A13041630) of **Group 21**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

`Admixture` is written in Python and requires several dependencies. A premade conda environment is provided for convenience, or packages can be installed manually. If installing conda for the first time, we suggest using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) as a lightweight installer.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install `Admixture`:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AdmixtureAnalysisTool.git
    ```
2. Next, configure the conda environment and other dependencies as follows:
    ```bash
    make setup
    ```
3. Finally, activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate admix
   ```

## Usage
Usage may vary depending on use case. An example usage is provided below:
```python
python admixture.py -m k7b -i ./sample-data/1.txt -o ./results
```

## Development
Currently, the package offers two models: [k7b](http://dodecad.blogspot.com/2012/01/k12b-and-k7b-calculators.html) and a model we inferred manually using SNP data from the [1000Genomes project](https://www.internationalgenome.org). Development is ongoing. Details on specific files and functions are available [here](https://github.com/raimonpv/admixture/tree/main/admixture).

### Tasks:
- [x] Configure initial tool
- [x] Configure environment
- [x] Build READMEs
- [x] Implement initial model
- [x] Implement 1000Genomes model
- [ ] Implement visualization
- [x] Provide sample data
- [x] Publish repository
